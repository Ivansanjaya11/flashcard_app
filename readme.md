**Flashcard App**

**Project Overview**

The Flashcard App is a command-line application designed to help users memorize information easily through a system of categorized flashcards. Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) flashcards and folders, allowing for flexible categorization and easy retrieval of information. All flashcard data will be stored in JSON format, ensuring easy data management and compatibility with various data-handling tools and libraries.

**Key Features**

3. Quiz mode: linear/randomized
4. Confirmation prompts for deletion operations
5. Export/import folders & flashcards via JSON files
6. Progress tracking (how many times a card has been reviewed, if it is mastered, how many (or percentage) a folder has been mastered, how many successful vs failed answers)
